This working folder was generated in the data organization and reproducibility course from PPGECOL UFRGS

In the folder "data", you find the GIS files (folder "GIS") which generate the climatic data present in the .xlsx file (folder "raw") and treated for the analysis use (.txt present in the folder "processed")

In the folder "R", you can find three scripts. In "C", I charge the processed data, in "D", I run an LM with two climatic data, and in "S", I export files to use in my future works (correlation figure) and manuscripts (correlation matrix and biome iD).

All the exported files can be found in the "output" folder.

Folder "doc" just presents a .docx file empty to charge in my GitHub.
